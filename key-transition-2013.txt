I am transitioning away from my old and obsolete 1024-bit DSA key as it is no
longer consistent with current best practices.  I am replacing it with a
4096-bit RSA key as described below.

The old key will remain usable for some time, but I would prefer the new key
to be used wherever possible, and expect to use it for all future signing
operations.  I would like the new key to be re-integrated into the web of
trust.  To certify the transition, this transition statement is signed by
both keys.

This was my old key (available at http://devin.com/pgp/E9ABFCD2.asc):

pub   1024D/E9ABFCD2 1999-07-20
      Key fingerprint = 13E7 199E DD1E 65F0 8905  2E43 5395 CA0D E9AB FCD2

This is my new key (available at http://devin.com/pgp/9197B5F9.asc):

pub   4096R/9197B5F9 2010-09-21
      Key fingerprint = 9C64 37CD 1B7B 029D 0933  49EA 1E52 7672 9197 B5F9

The new key may be imported with:

  curl -s http://devin.com/pgp/9197B5F9.asc | gpg --import

If you verified my identity and signed my old key, and if your signing policy
so permits, I would welcome your signature for the new one.

You can verify that I am in control of both keys by authenticating this
transition statement:

  curl -s http://devin.com/pgp/key-transition-2013.txt | gpg --verify

Thanks for your understanding.
